# Arrays - DS

Question URL: [https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem)

An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, ***A***, of size ***N***, each memory location has some unique index *i*, (where ***0<=i<=N*** ), that can be referenced as ***A[i]*** (you may also see it written as **A<sub>i</sub>**).

Given an array, ***A***, of ***N*** integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

**Note:** If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer,***N*** (the number of integers in ***A***).
The second line contains ***N*** space-separated integers describing ***A*** .

**Constraints**

* ***1 <= N <= 10<sup>3</sup>***
* ***1 <= A<sub>i</sub> 10<sup>4</sup>, where A<sub>i</sub> is the i<sup>th</sup> integer in A.***

**Output Format**

Print all ***N*** integers in ***A*** in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

**Sample Input 1**

```
4
1 4 3 2
```

| 1 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|

   **Array: arr**

**Sample Output 1**

```
2 3 4 1
```
